# Fraud Detection Model for Payment Transactions using Machine Learning
Fraudulent activities in payment transactions pose a significant risk to businesses and consumers alike. Detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time is crucial to prevent financial losses and protect the integrity of payment systems. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for fraud detection, enabling the development of sophisticated models that can accurately classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

In this study, I proposed a comprehensive approach to building a fraud detection model for payment transactions using machine learning techniques. My approach involves leveraging a diverse set of features, including transaction amount, transaction type and transaction metadata, to train and evaluate our model. I utilized a large labeled dataset of historical transactions to develop and optimize our model for online fraud detection.

## Methodology
Our proposed fraud detection model for payment transactions follows the following steps:

1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
